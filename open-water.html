      <h3>Welcome to </h3>
      <h1><strong>Open Water Scuba Initiative</strong></h1>
        <div class="well">
          <p>In an effort to create awareness regarding the depletion of healthy coral along the Great Barrier Reef, we organize tours of individuals who use their vacation time to make a difference. 
          </p>
          <p> 
          Our mission is to:
            <ol>
              <li>Clean and heal areas of the GBR influenced by human impact,</li>
              <li>Diminish coral depletion by preventionary measures like, covering and cooling, and</li>
              <li>Relocating threatened species to more accommodating areas.</li>
            </ol> 
          </p>
          <p>If this is a vacation you would like to take, we would love for you to be a part of our mission. Come and spend as little or as much time with us as you'd like. Our ocean friends would love for you to come and help them out!</p>  
        
          <p>

            <p>Each day we take a maximum of 20 experienced individuals, in 5 groups of 4, to work on the GBR. Volunteers must be experienced with not less than an PDI Open Water Rating. 
            </p>  
            <p>
              The advantage to volunteering with OWSI is that you come on our expedition for free. The consequence is that you'll have to work. The government of Australia covers the majority of our costs. The rest is up to private philanthopic donations. 
            </p>
            <p>Should you or anyone you know feel inclined to donate to our cause, please click on this <a href="owsidonations.html">link</a> to our donations page.
