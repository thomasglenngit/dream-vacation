      <h2>My Dream Vacation</h2>
        <p>This a description of a place I'd like to take my family to see. We don't get out much, so this is a very exciting prospect. Here are some reasons I want to get away:</p>
      <div class="well">
        <ul>
          <li>
            We live in Canada and it's really cold.
          </li>
          <li>
            My kids are driving me crazy because the've been in the house too long.
          </li>
          <li>
            My wife needs to pull away from her computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            We need to see other people and cultures.
          </li>
          <li>
            I need a tan.
          </li>
          <li>My wife and I are getting older and we would like to enjoy our health, while we still hav it.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="well">
        <p>Considering all of those factors, we made our decision to visit the <em>Great Barrier Reef</em> in <strong>Australia!</strong></p>
   
        <h2 class="prospect">Great Barrier Reef</h2>
      
        <p>The Great Barrier reef is the largest coral reef in all the world. It is over 3000 miles long from the North End to its southern end, off the West Coast of Australia. It is home to many species of fish plants and undersea wildlife that are nowhere else in all the world. Unfortunately, many of these lifeforms are under threat due to changes in ocean temperature resulting from climate change due to global warming.
        </p> 

        <p>Time is running out for opportunities to see this great wonder of the world. Although many parts of the Great Barrier reef are fluorescing and dying, there still remain many beautiful parts and portions to visit. It still remains one of the greatest places in the world to explore with scuba equipment.

          There are many things to consider before you come to Australia and visit the Great Barrier reef. Make sure, first of all, that you are a good swimmer and that you have some experience scuba diving. Try visiting your local swim facilities to see if they offer training. It might also be a good idea to purchase your own equipment.  That way you are familiar with your set and are able to adjust its settings to your preferences. Remember however, you cannot take pressurized tanks on the plane, but don't worry we will supply them here. So bring everything except those.

          <p>Choose from one of our many travel partners including: Qantas airlines, Air China, SAS airlines , United Airlines. Upon arrival in Queensland, one of our staff will meet you at the airport and escort you to the hotel where you have made reservations. We insist on 48 hours at least to adjust to our climate before attempting any scuba diving. We also insist on another 48 hours at the end of your stay before flying to your home destination to avoid complication in your circulatory/cardiovascular health.

          <p>In Cairns, there are many people with boats claiming to take you wherever you want. Some of them are legitimate, while others are less than virtuous persons who will overcharge you for a less-than-gratifying-experience. Here is a list of tried and true outfitters who will take you on an excursion to the Great Barrier reef. Just click on the outrigger of your choice!
